static block -- it is used to Initialize the static data member of class and it is executed only once even before the main method


init block -- initialized block is used to Initialize instance member of the class.it executed when you created object of class .even before the constructor is executed


Input / output in java.io
    
  --byte stream                                     --Character stream are two category of io   
 -input Stream (Read)   -output stream(Write)         -Reader              -writer   // this four are abstract classes
 *File InputStream       *File o Stream                *File Reader          *File writer// file work on single character at a time
 *Buffered Input Stream  *Buffered O Stream            *Buffered Reader      *Buffered Writer// in buffer we can work on bunch of character at a time(buffer = temp storage)
 *Data Input Stream      *Data O  S                    *Input S  Reader      *Output S Writer
 *Object Input Stream    *Object O S                                         *Print Writer
                         *Print Stream  
                         
Bridge classes(Input Stream reader and output Stream Writer work as a bridge)  are used to convert byte stream data to character stream
Data Input Stream and Data Output Stream are used to read write primitive specific data   respectively

read method will return you -1 in case of end of file      

if  using dataoutputstream to write data then for reading that need to use datainputstream then need to call appropriate methods in the same Sequence in which you are writing the program

**objectInputStream-- Reading object |  objectOutputStream -- writing the object in java.io

WriteObject(Object obj): to write object |obj is super class of all class
when we are writing any object serialization will happens
serialization is a process of converting state of object(data members) into byte stream
serializable <I>: java.io  (Marker interface)| not abstract

object readObject()
when you read object de-serialization will happen
De-Serialization is the process of converting state of object from byte stream to character stream

FileReader : reading data from file
FileWriter writing data into file

user innput:  system.in

system .out.println:
system : in bulit in java.lang

out : static data member of system class which object of outputstream (printStream ) and it internally represents
      standard output device i.e console
println : method of Printstream class      

java.lang
public class system{
      public static PrintStream out;// 
      public static PrintStream err;//print in red 
      public static InputStream in;
    }
    
  user Input  :
  
  system.in :
  in : static data member of system class which object of Inputstream  and it internally represents
      standard input device i.e keyboard
      
  InputStreamReader : is used to convert byte stream data into character stream//will work on single character at a time
   BuffererReader : used to work on bunch of cahracter at a time instead of working on single character at a time
